In this lab, we explore the multifaceted impacts of globalization on various countries. 
Using interactive visualizations based on a synthetic dataset, users can compare metrics such as trade volume, foreign investment, cultural exchange, and economic growth. 
This helps understand how globalization influences geopolitics and economic development.

**Key Concepts and Formulas:**

- **Globalization:** The interconnectedness of countries. No single formula; often measured by indices like the KOF Globalization Index.
- **Geopolitics:** The influence of geography on politics and international relations.
- **Trade Volume:** $Trade\ Volume = Exports + Imports$
- **Foreign Investment:** Investment in foreign enterprises, measured in monetary units.
- **Cultural Exchange:** Proxy metrics include international tourism, student exchanges, etc.
- **Economic Growth Rate:** $\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{GDP_{current} - GDP_{previous}}{GDP_{previous}} \times 100$
